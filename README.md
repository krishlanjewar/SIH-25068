## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **hackathon prototype** that demonstrates how **Digital Water Level Recorder (DWLR)** data can be ingested, visualized, and used for decision-making.  
It provides **real-time dashboards, alerts, and reports** for policymakers, researchers, and citizens.

---

## 📌 Features

- **Live/Simulated Data Flow**
  - Pulls DWLR (or mock) data into a lightweight backend.
  - Streams updates for dashboards.

- **Visualization Dashboard**
  - Interactive map of India with **district-level water status**.
  - Line & area graphs for **groundwater fluctuation**.

- **Alerts & Notifications**
  - “Critical depletion” push alerts when thresholds are crossed.
  - Citizens get **awareness notifications**, policymakers get **action signals**.

- **User Roles**
  - 👨‍💼 Policymaker → Macro view, downloadable reports.  
  - 🔬 Researcher → Graphs + CSV data export.  
  - 👥 Citizen → Alerts + awareness maps.  

- **Reports**
  - One-click **PDF/CSV summaries** for quick decisions.

## 📱 Demo Flow
1. DWLR station sends water level data.  
2. Backend ingests (mock/live).  
3. Dashboard visualizes map & graphs.  
4. Alerts trigger for **Red Zones**.  
5. User downloads a quick **report**.

## 🌟 Why It Matters
- Tackles a **GovTech + Social Impact** challenge.  
- First **mobile-friendly + real-time DWLR visualization** in India.  
- Goes beyond existing portals (ISRO Bhuvan = static, Jal Jeevan = supply-side only).  

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap
- 🤖 **AI Predictions** → Forecast groundwater trends.  
- 🔗 **Blockchain** → Tamper-proof water records.  
- 🕶️ **AR Overlays** → Visualize depletion in real space.
